# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Tyler

## About me
I'm a recent Mech eng grad of 2022 that has been using python since 2016. I've decided to start using github to document my code - analysing what you've done in the past can help you make big improvements.

I am currently focusing on improving my skills with the DjangoREST framework.

I enjoy playing around with different aspects of technology and finding ways to link them - it's why I'm currently working on my current project. I enjoy language learning, psychology, business, marketing and computing so I came up with a project that would link them all together.

## Tech stack

Languages - Python - Django, Flask; Node.JS
