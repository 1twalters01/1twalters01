# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Tyler

## About me
I'm a recent Mech eng grad of 2022 that has been using python since 2016. I enjoy reading about various topics such as finance and psychology, playing the piano and going to the gym. I've decided to start using github to document my code - analysing what you've done in the past can help you make big improvements. I am a big proponent of being the best version of yourself, and think that journaling can aid well on that endeavour.

I enjoy playing around with different aspects of technology and finding ways to link them - it's why I'm currently working on my current project. I enjoy language learning, psychology, business, marketing and computing so I came up with a project that would link them all together.

I am currently focusing on improving my data analytics skills and my use of the DjangoREST framework in my freetime.

I do quite a lot of freelancing in my spare time so progress on my project may be slow.
